- I am Lucia and I'm currently a student at kodehode🖥️
- currently I am learning c#🌱 and I really like making APIs 🧩 
- Like an annoying child constantly asking "why?" I am really enthusiastic about trying
  to understand how coding works and how different programs and software interact with each other.
